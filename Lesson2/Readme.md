# Lesson 2: Type and Object

In Python, every value has a data type, which defines the characteristics of that value such as what operations can be performed on it. Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't have to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. Python automatically determines the data type based on the value assigned to it.

## Types in Python

### 1. Int (Integer)
Integers are whole numbers without any decimal point. They can be positive or negative. Examples of integers are 5, -3, 100, etc.

### 2. Float (Floating-Point Number)
Floats are numbers that have a decimal point or use scientific notation. Examples of floats are 3.14, -0.001, 2.5e2, etc.

### 3. Str (String)
Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single quotes (''), double quotes ("") or triple quotes (''' or """). Examples of strings are "hello", 'Python', "123", etc.

### 4. Bool (Boolean)
Booleans represent one of two values: True or False. They are often used in conditional statements and comparisons.

## Examples in Python
```python 
# Integers 
x = 5 
y = -3 
 
# Floats 
pi = 3.14 
value = 2.5e2 
 
# Strings 
name = "Alice" 
message = 'Hello, World!' 
 
# Booleans 
is_true = True 
is_false = False
```
在這個教程中，我們介紹了 Python 的基本數據型別 - int，float，str 和 bool。理解這些數據型別對於編寫 Python 程式是至關重要的。請隨意探索更多關於這些型別以及如何在 Python 中使用它們的資訊。

In this tutorial, we covered the basic data types in Python - int, float, str, and bool. Understanding these data types is essential for writing Python programs. Feel free to explore more about these types and how to work with them in Python.

Happy coding!
